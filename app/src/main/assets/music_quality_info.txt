Dynamic Range
The difference between the loudest and softest passages.
The human ear can hear a range of sounds from very soft to very loud, covering about 90 decibels (dB). A 16-bit audio file can handle a dynamic range of up to 96 dB, while a 24-bit file can manage up to 144 dB

Dynamic Range Meter
Dynamic Range measures the contrast between the quietest and loudest parts of a song. Think of it as the music's ability to "breathe" â€“ to whisper intimately one moment and then deliver powerful crescendos the next.

What the Numbers Mean for Your Listening Experience

    What it sounds like: Good contrast between sections while maintaining cohesion
    Common in: Well-produced rock, pop from the 80s-90s, modern jazz, quality hip-hop
    Listening experience: Engaging, with enough variation to keep interest without quiet parts disappearing
    Examples: Michael Jackson's "Thriller," Steely Dan, well-mastered modern indie music

High DR (13-18 dB): "The Emotional Journey"
    What it sounds like: Distinct quiet passages building to powerful climaxes
    Common in: Jazz, acoustic performances, film scores, pre-1980s rock and soul
    Listening experience: Emotionally engaging, rewards active listening
    Examples: Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," Miles Davis, Adele's ballads
