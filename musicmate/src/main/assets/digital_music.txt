MQA Authentication
MQA is a superb technology for distributing high-quality recordings, to bring listeners
the sound of the studio and older recordings from the Archive.

The MQA ‘Studio’ (blue light) gives confirmation directly from mastering engineers,
producers or artists to their listeners. MQA Studio authenticates that the sound you are
hearing is exactly as played in the studio when the music was completed and, by implication,
that this is also the definitive version of the recording at that point in time.

A second level, ‘MQA’ (green light) is available to indicate that although the stream is
genuine, provenance may be uncertain or that it is not yet the final release.
