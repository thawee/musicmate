Dynamic Range
The difference between the loudest and softest passages.
The human ear can hear a range of sounds from very soft to very loud, covering about 90 decibels (dB). A 16-bit audio file can handle a dynamic range of up to 96 dB, while a 24-bit file can manage up to 144 dB

DRMeter
Dynamic Range (DR) measures how much the volume changes in a piece of music or an album. Low DR values, like DR3, mean the music is heavily compressed, with only a small difference (three decibels) between the quietest and loudest parts. Natural recordings, with less compression, have higher DR values, like DR12 or more. The DR system helps to understand the dynamic quality of music without making it a black-and-white issue. For example, DR7 is considered low for rock or jazz music but is acceptable for electronic club music, which often has DR values below DR4. Generally, music with DR values above DR12 has high dynamic quality.
