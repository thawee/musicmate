## Bit Depth & Dynamic Range
**Bit depth** determines the **dynamic range** (difference between softest and loudest sounds) in your music:

 - **16-bit audio:** 96dB range (CD quality)
 - **24-bit audio:** 144dB range (Studio quality)
 - **Human hearing:** ~90dB range

Higher bit depth means clearer quiet passages, smoother transitions between soft and loud moments, and more authentic sound reproduction.

## Dynamic Range Meter
Dynamic Range measures the contrast between the quietest and loudest parts of a song. Think of it as the music's ability to "breathe" â€“ to whisper intimately one moment and then deliver powerful crescendos the next.

### What the Numbers Mean for Your Listening Experience

#### Low DR (1-6 dB): "The Wall of Sound"

 - **Examples:** Most Billboard Hot 100 hits since 2000, mainstream EDM

#### Medium DR (7-12 dB): "The Sweet Spot"
    
 - **What it sounds like:** Good contrast between sections while maintaining cohesion

 - **Listening experience:** Engaging, with enough variation to keep interest without quiet parts disappearing
 - **Examples:** Michael Jackson's "Thriller," Steely Dan, well-mastered modern indie music

#### High DR (13-18 dB): "The Emotional Journey"

 - **What it sounds like:** Distinct quiet passages building to powerful climaxes
 - **Common in:** Jazz, acoustic performances, film scores, pre-1980s rock and soul
 - **Listening experience:** Emotionally engaging, rewards active listening
 - **Examples:** Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon," Miles Davis, Adele's ballads

#### Very High DR (19+ dB): "The Audiophile's Delight"

 - **What it sounds like:** Full preservation of natural instrument dynamics from whisper-quiet to full orchestra
