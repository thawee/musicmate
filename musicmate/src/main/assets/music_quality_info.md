## Bit Depth & Dynamic Range
**Bit depth** determines the **dynamic range** (difference between softest and loudest sounds) in your music:

 - **16-bit audio:** 96dB range (CD quality)
 - **24-bit audio:** 144dB range (Studio quality)
 - **Human hearing:** ~90dB range

Higher bit depth means clearer quiet passages, smoother transitions between soft and loud moments, and more authentic sound reproduction.

## Dynamic Range Meter
Dynamic Range measures the contrast between the quietest and loudest parts of a song. Think of it as the music's ability to "breathe" – to whisper intimately one moment and then deliver powerful crescendos the next.
